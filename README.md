#  Phishing Indicators Identified:

1. **Suspicious Sender Address**
   - Came from `support@msupdate.net`, which is not an official Microsoft domain.

2. **Urgent & Alarming Language**
   - “Your account has been compromised” is used to scare the user into clicking links.

3. **Mismatched Links**
   - The links (e.g., "Reset your password") could redirect to a fake site — phishing pages often impersonate real websites.

4. **Technical Details for Trust**
   - Fake inclusion of platform, browser, and IP to make it sound convincing.

5. **Professional Layout**
   - Design mimics Microsoft branding — phishing emails often copy official styles to look legit.
